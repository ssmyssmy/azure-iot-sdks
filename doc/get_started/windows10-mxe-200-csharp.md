# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect **MXE-200** device running Windows 10 with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][devbox-setup]
-   Computer with Git client installed and access to the
    [azure-iot-sdks](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks) GitHub public repository.
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]

# Step 2: Prepare your Device

-   Follow the instructions from [device website](http://www.adlinktech.com/PD/web/PD_detail.php?cKind=&pid=1505&seq=&id=&sid=&category=Fanless-Embedded-Computer_Integrated-Embedded-Computer&utm_source=).

# Step 3: Build and Run the sample

-   Download the [Azure IoT SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks) and the sample programs and save them to your local repository.
-   Start a new instance of Visual Studio 2015.
-   Open the **iothub_csharp_client.sln** solution in the `csharp\device` folder in your local copy of the repository.
-   In Visual Studio, from Solution Explorer, navigate to the **samples** folder.
-   In the **DeviceClientHttpSample** project, open the ***Program.cs*** file.
-   Locate the following code in the file:

        private const string DeviceConnectionString = "<replace>";
        
-   Replace `<replace>` with the connection string for your device.
-   In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **DeviceClientHttpSample** project, click **Debug**, and then click **Start new instance** to build and run the sample. The console displays messages as the application sends device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub.
-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application and how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.
